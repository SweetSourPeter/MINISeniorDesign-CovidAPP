# COVID-App

COVID-App is a tiny cross-platform mobile app developed using [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) to report and track your daily symptoms (or your status if you are not ill) in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. It also provides an Admin-Dashboard to monitor symptoms.

And here's why you might want to use it:

* You want to know what the latest COVID data in your country.
* You want to help slow down this pandemic by self-reporting your symptoms.
* You are a Flutter engineer and you want to see the difference between your team and the best Flutter team in the world.
